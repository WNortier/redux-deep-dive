> ### Redux is not tied to React, it is a library for JavaScript applications

Can be used with React, Angular, Vue or even vanilla JavaScript

## What is Redux?

- Redux is a state container which stores the state of your application
- The state of an app is the state shared by all the individual components of the App
- In Redux a pattern is enforced to ensure all state transitions are explicit and can be tracked

## Why Redux?

- If you want to manage the global state of your application in a predictable way Redux can help you
- The patterns and tools provided by Redux make it easier to understand when, where, why and how the state in your application is being updated, and how your application logic will behave when those changes occur

## What is Redux Toolkit?

- Redux toolkit is the official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development
- It is also intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic in your application moving forward

## Why Redux Toolkit?

- Configuring Redux in an app seems complicated
- Redux requires a lot of other packages to be installed to get redux to do something useful
- Redux requires too much boilerplate code

> ### Redux toolkit serves as an abstraction over redux. It hides the difficult parts ensuring you have a good developer experience

## What is React Redux?

React-Redux is the official Redux UI binding library for React

## When should you use Redux in your React application?

- Large amounts of state needed in many places in the app
- App state is updated frequently over time
- Logic to update that state may be complex
- The app has a medium or large sized codebase and may be worked on by many people
